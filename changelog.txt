---------------

Version 0.3 [SVN commit: 4, https://sourceforge.net/p/oxml/code/4/]
  - OutputFormat: TXmlOutputFormat = (ofNone, ofFlat, ofIndent) renamed to:
    IndentType: TXmlIndentType = (itNone, itFlat, itIndent)
  - TOXmlWriterIndentation and TOXmlWriter merged: now TOXmlWriter supports automatic indentation.
    Use TOXmlWriter.IndentType and TOXmlWriter.IndentString for automatic indentation.

    in a SAX event.
