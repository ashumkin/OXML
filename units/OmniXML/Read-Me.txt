This is the original OmniXML (www.omnixml.com) from November 2013,
updated with text reader and writer from OXml.
The advantages are faster reading and writing of XML and support of
Lazarus and Delphi ARC compilers (iOS, Android).

I have made as little changes in OmniXML as possible. This approach
enables you to update your old projects based on OmniXML without
changing a line of code and needing to test your projects on errors.
